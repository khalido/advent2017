[Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017)

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This here is my python 3 solutions for all 25 days of the advent of code 2017 puzzles.

- [Day 1: Inverse Captcha](https://github.com/khalido/advent2017/blob/master/Day%2001%20-%20Inverse%20Captcha.ipynb) - this was trivial. 
- [Day 24](https://github.com/khalido/advent2017/blob/master/Day%2024%20-%20Electromagnetic%20Moat.ipynb) looks like a simple graph problem but it took ages to build a working recursive solution. Thats slow, so need to implement a stack based one.
- [Day 25: Turing Machine] - this was one of the simplest advent problems so far. Probably becuase one of the earlier puzzles involved using a dispatch table. This was also one of the very few puzzles I got right on the first attempt without having to google!
