# adventofcode

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This here is my solutions for Advent of Code 2015-20 as jupyter notebooks. Most of the solutions are pretty verbose as I've left in the interim code as I work through each puzzle one step at a time.

For AOC 2020, I'm doing quick and dirty solutions in this repo and posting cleaned up versions to my blog: https://khalido.org/python/advent-of-code-2020.html. At some point in the future I'll make a blog post for each AOC year.

One day, I will highlight some of the more interesting problems here.
