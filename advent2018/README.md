# adventofcode

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This here is my solutions for Advent of Code 2018 as jupyter notebooks. Most of the solutions are pretty verbose as I've left in the iterim code as I work through each puzzle one step at a time.
