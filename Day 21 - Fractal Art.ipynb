    "# --- Day 21: Fractal Art ---\n",
    "\n",
    "You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (#) or off (.). The program always begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the pattern is both 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall, it is said to have a size of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the program repeats the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the size is evenly divisible by 2, break the pixels up into 2x2 squares, and convert each 2x2 square into a 3x3 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.\n",
    "Otherwise, the size is evenly divisible by 3; break the pixels up into 3x3 squares, and convert each 3x3 square into a 4x4 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.\n",
    "Because each square of pixels is replaced by a larger one, the image gains pixels and so its size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The artist's book of enhancement rules is nearby (your puzzle input); however, it seems to be missing rules. The artist explains that sometimes, one must rotate or flip the input pattern to find a match. (Never rotate or flip the output pattern, though.) Each pattern is written concisely: rows are listed as single units, ordered top-down, and separated by slashes. For example, the following rules correspond to the adjacent patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "../.#  =  ..\n",
    "          .#\n",
    "\n",
    "                .#.\n",
    ".#./..#/###  =  ..#\n",
    "                ###\n",
    "\n",
    "                        #..#\n",
    "#..#/..../#..#/.##.  =  ....\n",
    "                        #..#\n",
    "                        .##.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for a rule to use, rotate and flip the pattern as necessary. For example, all of the following patterns match the same rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".#.   .#.   #..   ###\n",
    "..#   #..   #.#   ..#\n",
    "###   ###   ##.   .#.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the book contained the following two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "../.# => ##./#../...\n",
    ".#./..#/### => #..#/..../..../#..#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the program begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ".#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the grid (3) is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3. It divides evenly into a single square; the square matches the second rule, which produces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#..#\n",
    "....\n",
    "....\n",
    "#..#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of this enhanced grid (4) is evenly divisible by 2, so that rule is used. It divides evenly into four squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#.|.#\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "--+--\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "#.|.#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these squares matches the same rule (../.# => ##./#../...), three of which require some flipping and rotation to line up with the rule. The output for the rule is the same in all four cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "---+---\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the squares are joined into a new grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, after 2 iterations, the grid contains 12 pixels that are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many pixels stay on after 5 iterations?**"
